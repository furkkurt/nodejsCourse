Dawn breaks over the Great Northern.

2. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
    
We hear him before we see him, but DALE COOPER is perched six inches above
the floor in a one-handed yoga "frog" position, wearing boxer shorts and a pair of
socks, talking into the tape recorder which is sitting on the carpet near his head.
    
				COOPER
		Diane ... 6:18 a.m., room 315, Great Northern
		Hotel up here in Twin Peaks. Slept pretty well.
		Non-smoking room. No tobacco smell. That's a
		nice consideration for the business traveller. A
		hint of douglas fir needles in the air. As Sheriff
		Truman indicated they would, everything this
		hotel promised, they've delivered: clean,
		reasonably priced accomodations ... telephone
		works ... bathroom in really tip-top shape ... no
		drips, plenty of hot water with good, steady
		pressure ... could be a side-benefit of the
		waterfall just outside my window ... firm
		mattress, but not too firm ... and no lumps like
		that time I told you about down in El Paso ...
		Diane, what a nightmare that was, but of course
		you've heard me tell that story once or twice
		before. Haven't tried the television. Looks like
		cable, probably no reception problems. But the
		true test of any hotel, as you know, is that
		morning cup of coffee, which I'll be getting back
		to you about within the half hour ... Diane, it
		struck me again earlier this morning; there are
		two things that continue to trouble me, and I'm
		not just speaking as an agent of the Bureau but
		also as a human being: what really went on
		between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?
		And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?
							CUT TO:
    
3. EXT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S HOUSE - MORNING
    
A rustic log house, with the Sheriffs cruiser parked in front. A rooster crows.
SHERIFF TRUMAN exits the house, carrying a soiled paper bag. He walks around
the side yard to a chicken coop and scatters the feed he has in the bag into the
coop. They start clucking and pecking.
    
    
				TRUMAN
		How you girls doin' this morning? Sounds like
		you got plenty to talk about today. Hope it's
		good news.
    
He empties the bag and starts towards the cruiser.

4. EXT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DAY
    
A sign reads: WAGON-WHEEL DO-NUTS.
							CUT TO:
5. INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - MORNING
    
A banner reads: GO AHEAD; MAKE MY DONUT. Another banner reads:
SQUARE DEALS ON ROUND DONUTS.
    
DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN and LUCY MORAN are at the counter, in the middle of
ordering.
    
				LUCY
		... two boxes of chocolate creams with jimmies, a
		box of maple bearclaws, one raspberry swizzle
		twist, two boxes of jelly donuts
			(to Andy)
		I'm ordering extra jelly donuts because they're
		Agent Cooper's favorite, you know my aunt I told
		you about with the raccoons? She liked jelly
		donuts, they were her favorite, but she doesn't
		remind me at all of Agent Cooper.
			(a new thought)
		Her son, though, does -
    
				ANDY
		And one plum frappe turnover.
							CUT TO:
6. INT. SHERIFF'S CRUISER - MORNING
    
Truman drives past Wagon-Wheel Do-Nuts just in time to see Lucy and Andy
leaving the shop, with Andy carrying a stack of donut boxes up to his neck.
    
Truman pulls into the parking lot next to them and leans out the window.
    
				TRUMAN
		Can I give you three a lift?
    
				LUCY
			(looking atound)
		But Sheriff, there's only two of us.
    
    
Truman and Andy look at each other.

7. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL DINING ROOM - DAY
    
Dale Cooper sits at a choice corner table, holding a fresh, hot cup of coffee, as a
WAITRESS stands by, holding the coffee pot.
    
				COOPER
			(holding up a hand to stop her)
		Wait right there, wait right there ...
			(he sniffs the coffee; hmm ... he sips)
		You know, this is, excuse me, a damn good cup
		of coffee. I've had I can't tell you how many
		cups of coffee I've had in my life and this ...
			(another sip)
		... this is one of the best.
    
				WAITRESS
		Thank you.
    
				COOPER
		I'd like two eggs, over hard, don't tell me, I
		know it's hard on the arteries but old habits die
		hard, just about as hard as I want those eggs ...
		bacon, super crispy, almost burned: cremate it --

8. AUDREY HORNE
    
Across the room, watching Cooper order. She slips into her beguiling, rip-your-
heart-out routine and sashays across the dining room to Cooper's table.
    
				COOPER (CONTINUED)
			(just finishing up)
		... that's great, I'll have the grapefruit juice, as
		long as ...
			(sees Audrey approaching)
		... those grapefruits are freshly squeezed.
    
The Waitress departs. Audrey smiles.
    
				AUDREY
		My name is Audrey Home.
    
				COOPER
		Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent
		Dale Cooper.
    
    
				AUDREY
		Can I sit here?
    
				COOPER
			(pleasantly)
		Miss Home, unless I miss my guess, your father is
		Benjamin Home, the owner of this fine
		establishment, so I guess you can sit anywhere
		you like. And I'd also like to add it would be my
		pleasure.
    
Audrey sits, a little confused, runs a hand over her forehead.
    
				AUDREY
		You know, sometimes I get so flushed ... it's
		interesting.
    
				COOPER
		Were you a friend of Laura Palmer's?
    
				AUDREY
		Not exactly.
    
				COOPER
		Her father works for your father. Did you know
		each other growing up?
    
				AUDREY
		Oh we knew each other ...
    
				COOPER
		But there was something about her you didn't
		like.
    
				AUDREY
		Everybody liked Laura. She was just Little Miss
		Perfect. Laura tutored my older brother Johnny
		three times a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and
		he's in the third grade. He's got emotional
		problems; it runs in the family. Do you like my
		ring?
			(holds out her hand to show a big rock))
    
				COOPER
		Very nice.
    
				AUDREY
		My father bought it for me. my father was crazy
		about Laura. He bought her a pony when she
		was nine, but he let her father say it was from
		him. Its name was Troy.
			(absent-mindedly rubs her left palm)
		Do your palms ever itch?
    
Cooper studies her benignly.

9. BENJAMIN HORNE
    
Crossing the hallway outside the dining room, he glances in and sees his daughter
sitting with Dale Cooper. He stops, takes this in, then moves on.

10. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE MORNING
    
The trucker, LEO JOHNSON, is obsessively cleaning the cab of his semi rig with a
dustbuster. A bucket of hot water, some sponges and a hose are at the ready
nearby. We see that Leo's name is stenciled on the rig's door, along with the
name, "BIG PUSSYCAT." SHELLY JOHNSON, in her waitress uniform, comes up
to the truck.
    
				SHELLY
		Leo, honey? I gotta go to work now, Norma'll be
		here any sec ... Leo?
    
Leo turns off the dustbuster and turns to her.
    
				LEO
		Did you finish cleaning my boots?
    
				SHELLY
		They're all done and I did the laundry, too.
    
				LEO
		All of it?
    
				SHELLY
		Well yeah.
    
				LEO
		No you didn't.
    
He grabs a used grocery bag full of dirty clothes from the cab and flings it at her.
    
				SHELLY
		Sure, Leo, when I get home I'll -
    
				LEO
		Now, Shelly.
    
				SHELLY
		Okay.
    
Shelly starts back towards the house.
							CUT TO:
    
11.  INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - MORNING
    
Shelly dumps the clothes out of the grocery bag onto a laundry basket in front of
the washer. She shakes out the clothes before putting them in. She stops short
when she sees a large, dark red bloodstain on a faded blue cowboy work shirt.
    
She starts to tremble. She hears a car horn beep outside. She looks out the
window, sees Norma's car pull in near the truck but she doesn't see Leo.
    
She hears the screen door open and bang shut in the other roorn.
    
				LEO'S VOICE
		Shelly? Norma's here.
    
Shelly makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained shirt and stashes it
behind the washer, dumps the rest of the clothes in the washer, loads the
detergent, closes the door and starts it just as Leo comes in the roorn.
    
				LEO
		Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's here?
    
				SHELLY
		I heard you, Leo.
    
She starts out. He catches her by the arm.
    
				LEO
		I'm gonna come by the diner sometime today.
		Be a good girl and save me a piece 'a pie.
    
He pinches her cheek softly and holds it.
    
				SHELLY
			(manages a smile)
		Sure, Leo.
    
He works her cheek for a moment, squeezing a bit harder. Shelly hides her fear.
    
							CUT TO:

12. EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE/INT. NORMA'S CAR - MORNING
    
Norma sits behind the wheel of a maroon '64 Falcon station wagon. Shelly gets in
beside her and they drive off.
    
				NORMA
		Leo sure keeps that truck up, doesn't he?
    
				SHELLY
		He sure does.
    
				NORMA
			(glance at her, sees her condition)
		We're sure a couple a' characters, aren't we
		Shelly?
    
				SHELLY
		Norma, you said a mouthful and then some.
    
				NORMA.
		Guys ...
			(shakes her head)
    
				SHELLY
			(shakes her head)
		Guys.
    
				NORMA
		'You hear what happened at the Roadhouse last
		night?
    
				SHELLY
		No.
    
				NORMA
		Big fight. Bobby Briggs hit Ed Hurley with some
		brass knuckles -
    
				SHELLY
		Bobby hit Ed? Weird.
    
They look at each other, each knowing the other's secret but not saying so.
    
				NORMA
		Ed's got a concussion. Then Bobby and Mike got
		into it with the Bookhouse boys, took two patrol
		cars to break it up. Bobby and Mike're probably
		still in jail.

				SHELLY

		... Guys.
    
				NORMA
		Guys.

14. INT. SHERIFFS STATION RECEPTION AREA - MORNING
    
Deputy Andy takes a big bite of his plum frappe turnover, just as Dale Cooper
breezes through the front door and waves brightly as he passes.
    
				COOPER
		Morning, Deputy.
    
				ANDY
			(his mouth completely full)
		Good morning, Agent Cooper.
    
Lucy, at the coffee station holding a pot and a cup, turns to face Cooper, with a
doughnut stuck in her mouth.
    
				COOPER
		Hey there, Lucy.
    
				LUCY
			(barely intelligible)
		Agent Cooper, I got jelly for you special, the
		Sheriff's down the hall in Interrogation.
    
				COOPER
		I'll just look for him down the hall in
		Interrogation.
    
He moves down the hall.
							CUT TO:
15. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - MORNING
    
Cooper whisks in just as Truman, coffee mug in hand, takes an enormous bite of a
humongous bearclaw.
    

						(Revised pink 8-18-89)

				COOPER
		Hey, Sheriff: three for three.
    
Truman tries to chew, holds up his hand to be patient. Cooper sits.
    
				COOPER (CONTINUED)
		Number one, James Hurley: as soon as his lawyer
		gets here we bring him up from Cell Four and
		talk to him straight. He was in love with Laura
		Palmer, my bet is she told him whatever dirt she
		knew about Bobby and Mike and who knows
		what else ... if James plays ball we send him off
		with our blessings and a firm reminder to watch
		his back when Mike and Bobby hit the streets ...
			(Truman nods, trying to chew fast)
		Then we'll have a chat with those two
		perpetrators, let's run a top to bottom on
		Bobby's vehicle and in the meantime let's find
		out what the autopsy report on Laura Palmer
		gives us.
			(he rises)
		I've got the rest of the day mapped out. I'll meet
		you back here in interrogation ... I really have to
		urinate. By the way, the coffee at the Great
		Northern? Incredible.

He exits, just as Truman finally swallows his mouthful of bearclaw.
    
							CUT TO:
16. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
    
JAMES HURLEY is seated, next to his LAWYER, across from Truman, as Cooper
enters and sits beside the Sheriff.
    
				TRUMAN
		James has been advised of his rights.
    
				COOPER
		James, you were placed under arrest for suspicion
		of murder, the murder of Laura Palmer. You
		have no previous criminal record, is that correct?
    
				JAMES
		None. No, sir.
    
Cooper turns on the VCR and we see the same videotape of Laura and Donna at
the picnic that we saw earlier. James watches the video.
    

						(Revised pink 8-18-89)

				COOPER
		James, did you shoot this video tape?

Cooper fast forwards to the freeze frame of the motorcycle reflected in Laura's eye. 

				COOPER (CONTINUED)
		Isn't that your cycle, James?

				JAMES
		Yes, sir, it is. The three of us went up there two
		Sundays ago.

				COOPER
			(gently)
		James, you were in love with Laura.
			(James is silent)
		The two of you were seeing each other secretly.
		No one else at the school, or any of her friends
		knew about it; she was the homecomecoming queen,
		her boyfriend was the captain of the football
		team. How much longer did you think you could
		keep this relationship secret?

				JAMES
		It was secret because that's the way she wanted it.

				COOPER
		Why do you suppose that was, James? Do you
		think it had something to do with Bobby?

				JAMES
		It had everything to do with Bobby.

				COOPER
		Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?

				JAMES
		I think so.

				COOPER
		Did you know that Laura was using cocaine?

				JAMES
			(pause)
		Yes.

				COOPER
		Did you ever take cocaine with her?
    

						(Revised pink 8-18-89)
    
				JAMES
		No, I tried to get her to stop.

				COOPER
		When was the last time you saw her?

				JAMES
		Two nights ago. The night she died. For about
		three hours. She snuck out of her house about
		9:30. About 12:30 I stopped the bike at the light
		at Sparkwood and 21. She jumped off and ran
		away. I didn't see her again.
    
				COOPER
		You're sure it was 12:30?
    
				JAMES
		Yes, sir, Steve's Liquor Locker was closing up as
		we drove by and he closes right at 12:30.
    
				COOPER
		'You and Laura have a fight?
    
				JAMES
		Not exactly. But she said she couldn't see me
		anymore.
    
				COOPER
		Why?
    
				JAMES
		She didn't say.
    
				COOPER
		Was she high that night?
    
				JAMES
		Yes.
    
				COOPER
		Where did she get her drugs?
    
				JAMES
		I don't know. Most of the time we were together
		she was clean.

				COOPER
		Did she get her drugs from Bobby?

						(Revised pink 8-18-89).
    
				JAMES
		I really don't know where she got 'em she never
		talked about it. She didn't like that part of herself.

				COOPER
		Why did she start using again?

				JAMES
			(getting emotional)
		I don't know. Something happened, a couple of days ago -

				COOPER
		What happened?

				JAMES
		I don't know exactly. I think something scared
		her. She wouldn't talk to me, she wouldn't see
		me for a couple days -

				COOPER
		Until the last night.

				JAMES
		Yes.

				COOPER
		Did she call you that night?

				JAMES
		Yes.
    
Cooper looks at Laura's diary, open in front of him, at the page for February 5th;
the page marked "DAY ONE." He takes the half-heart necklace from his pocket.

				COOPER
		Do you recognize this necklace, James?

				 JAMES
		Yes, sir.    
    
				COOPER
		James, what happened on February fifth?
    
Tears form in his eyes. He fights them back.
							WHITE OUT TO:
17.  EXT. PARK - DAY
    
Laura Palmer, lying on a picnic blanket, playfully turns to face James.
    

						(Revised pink 8-18-89)
   
				LAURA
		What day is it today?

				JAMES
		Sunday.

				LAURA
		No, I mean the date.

				JAMES
		The fifth of February.

				LAURA
		Okay. It's an important day for me, James.
		You've got three guesses why I'm so happy today.

				JAMES
		Because you're the most beautiful girl in the world?

    
				LAURA
		No.
    
				JAMES
		Because you have the cutest nose in the world?
    
				LAURA
		No.
    
				JAMES
		Because your skin is so soft and you smell so
		good?
    
				LAURA
		No.
    
				JAMES
		Why?
    
				LAURA
		Because I really believe that you love me.
    
She takes the necklace from her pocket, "breaks" the heart in two, gives half to
James and puts the other half around her neck.

Sitting in interrogation. Looks up at Cooper.

19. EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY


Leo is putting the last touches on polishing his truck, when he's struck by a
troubling thought. He throws open the door of the cab and frantically searches
behind and under the driver's seat. He can't find what he's looking for.
    
				LEO
		Darnn it.
    
He jumps down from the cab and runs towards the house.
    
							CUT TO:
20.  INT. JOHNSON HOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
    
Leo hurries in, throws open the top of the washer, pulls out the full load of soggy
laundry and searches through them, looking for the bloody shirt that he does not
find.
    
				LEO
		NO!
    
Leo kicks the washer hard. The washer goes "tilt" and makes a loud, rhythmic
honking sound.

21. INT. DONNA HAYWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY
    
DONNA HAYWARD lies asleep in bed. The sound of an operatic aria drifts
through the room, originating downstairs. Donna shifts, starting to waken,
stretches and smiles like an untroubled angel. Then her eyes open and she
remembers Laura's death.
    
							CUT TO:
22. INT. HAYWARD LIVING ROOM - DAY
    
Donna enters the room, where her mother, EILEEN, sits in her wheelchair doing
some elaborate needlepoint, listening to the opera on the hi-fi.
    
				DONNA
		Mom?
			(Eileen doesn't hear her)
		Mom?
    
				EILEEN
		Oh, good morning, dear, I didn't hear you come
		down.
    
She uses a remote control to turn down the volume of the hi-fi and takes her
daughter's hand.
    
				DONNA
		Mom, it's ten-thirty, why didn't you wake me? I
		was supposed to go back down to the sheriff's --
    
				EILEEN
		They called this morning and said they could wait
		until tomorrow to see you. Your father and I
		thought you should rest. You woke us crying in
		your sleep last night, do you remember?
    
				DONNA
		No, really?
    
				EILEEN
		We feel so badly for you, we're so sorry.
    
				DONNA
			(sits beside her)
		Mom, it's so strange. I know I should be sad,
		and I am, part of me is, but I ... it's like I'm
		having the most beautiful dream and the most
		terrible nightmare all at once.
    
				EILEEN
		Your father told me you went out last night to
		meet a boy named James Hurley. Does this have
		anything to do with him?
    
				DONNA
			(nods, decides to confide)
		Can this be between you and me?
    
				EILEEN
			(takes her hand)
		Of course it can.
    
				DONNA
		James and Laura were seeing each other the last
		two months. They fell in love. I was the only
		one who knew about it. James was so good for
		her, you don't know how troubled Laura was, the
		kind of trouble she was in and how much she
		wanted to get away from Bobby --
    
				EILEEN
		I've been waiting for something like this about
		Bobby. And what about Mike?
    
				DONNA
		Mom, Laura and I made a pact. We wanted to get
		away from them, from both of them --
    
				EILEEN
		Are you saying you think Bobby had something
		to do with Laura's death?
    
				DONNA
		I don't know. I think Bobby's dangerous, I think
		he's capable of almost anything.
    
				EILEEN
		What did you tell the police?
    
				DONNA
		Nothing, I don't have any proof of anything and
		what's terrible is James was with Laura the night
		she died, but Mom I know he didn't do it.
			(close to tears)
		Last night, I had to see him, we were the two
		people closest to her in the world. But I feel so
		bad ...
    
				EILEEN
		Why angel?
    
				DONNA
		Because we realized that all this time ... we were
		the ones who were failing in love. I feel like I've
		betrayed my best friend ...
			(tears)
		.. but if that's true, then why do I feel so happy?
    
Donna falls into her mother's arms.

23. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
    
LELAND PALMER sits behind his desk, talking on the telephone. His SECRETARY
sits across from him.
    
				LELAND
		... Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R ... yes, that's correct, my
		daughter ... her name was Laura ... I'm calling to
		make the arrangements, the funeral, everything, I
		want everything taken care of, I don't care how
		much it costs and if you don't mind, I'd prefer.
		that we not even discuss money
    
During above, Benjamin Home enters, stops and listens.
    
				LELAND (CONTINUED)
		... I don't understand the question ... what's the
		difference? What do you mean "leak" ...
		seepage? I think I --
			(loses it, almost a moan)
		-- no, don't --
			(screams)
		DON'T TELL ME!!!  DON'T TELL ME!!!
    
He pushes the phone and everything else on his desk away from him. He gets up,
crosses to a cabinet stereo, turns on the sound on a modem jazz quartet record,
9/4 time, about as loud as it can go.
    
Benjarnin goes to the Secretary.


						(Revised pink 8-18-89)

				BENJAMIN
			(quietly)
		Take him to the lounge and call Dr. Jacoby.
    
She nods, goes to Leland, takes him gently by the arm and leads him out of the
room.
    
Benjamin Home turns down the sound on the stereo, goes to the desk and picks
up the phone.
    
				BENJAMIN (CONTINUED)
		This is Benjamin Horne, who am I speaking to?
		... fine ... mahogany and teak? well, you can
		forget that, Mr. Formaldehyde, I'm picking up
		the tab here and you vampires are not taking a
		bite out of my checkbook in order to exploit my
		colleague's tragedy ... start thinking lead.
    
He slams down the phone, just as we hear, from outside
    
				JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
		No, no, no, don't put 'em in my room, in here,
		through that door right there!
    
JERRY HORNE, Benjamin's younger, wiry brother enters, followed by four
BELLHOPS, carrying a mess of mismatched Samsonite.
    
				BENJAMIN
		Good to have you back, Jerry, how was Paris?
    
				JERRY
			(shakes his hand)
		In a minute ...
			(turns back to the Bellhops, points down)
		Right THERE, no, no, right THERE!
    
The Bellhops careftilly set the bags down as directed.
    
				JERRY (CONTINUED)
		What's the matter with Leland? Looks like
		somebody shot his dog.
    
The Bellhops all stop and took at Benjamin.
    
				JERRY (CONTINUED)
		What is WITH you guys? I've got a sandwich in
		there and I want all those bags opened - we're
		looking 'til we find it.
    

The Bellhops hop to it; all the bags are opened. Jerry tosses clothes around the
room until he finds a baguette with brie wrapped in white paper.
    
				JERRY (CONTINUED)
		Brother Ben, this is the best damn sandwich I
		ever ate, it's a baguette, with brie and butter, had
		four of these damn things every day I was there.
			(he reaches in and finds another one)
		Got a couple left - here, try one.
    
				BENJAMIN

DR. HAYWARD opens the folder containing Laura's autopsy report, ready to share

		her her entire life; she was my daughter's best
		friend. I couldn't bring myself to do the post-
		mortem, so last night I called in Joe Fielding from
		Fairvale. He did the work, I assisted, this is what
		he found 
			(puts on glasses, consults the sheet)
		Time of death estimated to be between midnight
		and four a.m. What killed her was loss of blood.
		Numerous shallow wounds, no single one serious
		enough to have been the cause of death. Bite
		marks. On her tongue, probably self-inflicted.
		Lesions on wrists, ankles and upper arms, where
		she was bound. We're waiting on toxological
		tests for drug use. Within the last twelve hours of
		her life, she had sexual relations with at least three
		men.

He rugs again on the loose thread on his sleeve; a button pops off his shirt, hits
and table and spins. He takes off his glasses, wipes his eyes.

				COOPER
		And you've examined Ronette Pulaski as well.

				HAYWARD
			(composing himself)
		Yes. Wound patterns are consistent. In my
		mind, there's no question the same perpetrator
		attacked them both.

				TRUMAN
		Doc, when, if ever, will Ronette be able to talk to
		us?

				HAYWARD
		She suffered a severe head wound, it's still too
		early to tell, add to that the psychological impact
		of the fear, probably witnessing what happened
		to Laura before her ...

				COOPER
		The answer's in there somewhere.
    
Doc Hayward looks at a close-up picture of Laura taken where she was found on

				BOBBY
		Leo called you?
    
				MIKE
		Yesterday. He was looking for you. He wanted

				BOBBY
		What'd you tell him, Snake?
    
				MIKE
		Hey, as far as I knew he didn't have any of it yet, I
		thought the deal was we were supposed to give it

				BOBBY
		Yeah, Thursday.
    
				MIKE
		Wait a minute, that night we followed Laura back

				BOBBY
		Check. We had a couple brewskis and I
		dropped you off.

    
				MIKE
		Check.
    
				BOBBY
			(lowering his voice further)
		And then I went to see Leo, 'cause I had this
		money burning a ten thousand dollar hole in my
		pocket.
    
				MIKE
		What about the other half?
    
				BOBBY
		It's in Laura's safe deposit box.
    
				MIKE
		You didn't get it back from her?

		She was supposed to hand it over today. Then

				MIKE
		So how we gonna get that ten grand for Leo?
    
				BOBBY

		I don't know, Snake. Maybe we could sell light-

		Look at him, what a cute little fellow, what's his name?

				JOSIE
		Koro.

				COOPER
			(filing this away)
		Koro. Koro. That means something.

    
				JOSIE        
		Chinese. I am not sure exactly. My late husband
		Andrew named him. "Big, stearning engine" perhaps?
    
Cooper start to bend down to pet Koro, Truman tries to signal him not to. A growl, a yip and
Cooper withdraws his hand.
    
				COOPER
		Mrs. Packard, I'll come right to the point. Mrs.
		Packard, I understand that you'd hired Laura
		Palmer to come see you twice a week to help you
		with your English, is that correct?
    
				JOSIE
		Yes, you see my late husband, Andrew ... I first
		learned English from him, when we met in Hong
		Kong but I have learned after his death that he
		spoke only in what you would call "western cliches" --
    
				COOPER
		That's very interesting, Mrs. Packard, so you
		hired Laura to help you
    
				JOSIE
		That is the ticket, because I was apparently not
		even saying the cliches correctly.
    
				COOPER
		When was the last time you saw Laura?
    
				JOSIE
		Thursday afternoon, about the time the mill blew five.
    
				COOPER
		That would be five o'clock?
    
				JOSIE
		Yes.
    
				COOPER
		When did she leave?
    
				JOSIE
		After one hour, when the lesson was finished. I
		did not see her again.

				COOPER
		How did she seem to you on Thursday afternoon?


				JOSIE
		Something was bothering her but we did not
		have a heart-to-heart on it. She said one thing,
		though, which stuck to my mind. She said, "I think
		now I know how you feel about your husband's death."
    
				COOPER
		Did she say what that was in reference to?

				JOSIE
		No, but I think of it now like an old song with a
		haunting melody that I can't stop hearing in my head.

				COOPER
		Uh-huh. Did you ask her then what she meant by this?

				JOSIE
		It was just as she was leaving. There was no time.
    
She stares at the floor. Cooper and Truman look at each other. The phone rings.
    
				JOSIE (CONTINUED)
		Excuse me, please ...
    
She rises and exits. Cooper smiles strangely at Truman.

				TRUMAN

		How did you know?

		Geez ... uh, not long. About six weeks. Andrew
		died a year and a half ago.

		Bobby, it's your favorite; meatloaf with pimentos

		in the kitchen.
    
She sits down at the table with them. Major Briggs and his wife bow their heads
but Bobby doesn't.
    
				MAJOR BRIGGS
		For what we are about to receive, may the Lord
		make us truly thankful.
    
Bobby indifferently moves his meatloaf around the plate and mashes up the chips
with a spoon.
    
    
				MAJOR BRIGGS (CONTINUED)
		Robert, I was hoping we'd have a chance to
		discuss the events of the past few days. Not the
		physical events themselves necessarily, but the
		thoughts and feelings surrounding them.
    
Bobby rolls his eyes. Major Briggs is undeterred.
    
				MAJOR BRIGGS (CONTINUED)
		Rebellion in a young man of your age is a
		necessary fact of life and, candidly, a sign of
		strength. In other words, I respect your
		rebellious nature, Bobby, however, being your
		father, I am obligated to contain that fire of
		contrariness within the bounds established by
		society as well as those within our own family
		structure.
    
Bobby impatiently taps his water glass with his knife.
    
				MAJOR BRIGGS (CONTINUED)
		Bobby, I note your reluctance to engage in a
		dialogue with me, your father. There are times
		when silence is golden. Silence can be taken
		many ways; as a sign of intelligence ... truth being
		invisible ... and the quieter we become, the more
		we can hear ...
    
Bobby shakes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. The Major calmly and firmly
backhands Bobby across the face. The cigarette flies across the table and spears
into the meatloaf on Betty's plate.
    
Bobby's stunned more than hurt.
    
				MAJOR BRIGGS (CONTINUED)
		I am a tolerant man, but my patience has its
		limits. "To have his path made clear for him is
		the aspiration of every human being in our
		beclouded and tempestuous existence." Robert,
